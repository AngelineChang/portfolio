          <div class="overview-left">
            <p>This is a 4-month project from the Human-Computer Interaction class in which students were separated into groups
              to design a web/mobile app together utilizing the knowledge from Don Norman's book <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Design-Everyday-Things-Revised-Expanded-ebook/dp/B00E257T6C" class="link">The Design of Everyday Things</a> and the
              knowledge from psychology such as visual perception, attention, memory, metal workload, emotion, etc.
              Our team worked on designing an app to make it easier for people who are not familiar with Taipei
              to use the public transportation system.</p>
            <p>In this project, we first analyzed the activity of using the public transportation in Taipei with the Activity/Task/Action level structure and
            the Seven Stages of Action, and then conducted user research to further understand the issue. Before kicking off the design, we performed task analysis and card sorting with users
            to understand the use cases as well as the information ecosystem and structure of this app. Next, we defined the brand identity and visual style of this app, and created a mid-/high- fiedility prototype for the user testing and iterated our design.</p>

          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>We started working on this project by thinking about the system image of our product and analyzing the the activity of using the public transportation in Taipei
            with the Activity/Task/Action level structure and the Seven Stages of Action from <i>The Design of Everyday Things</i>, to gain a preliminary understanding of the issue.</p>
          <h3>What system image and expectations might our users hold?</h3>
          <p>Since our product is an app to help people use the public transportation in Taipei, we assumed that our users would expect our app to provide the feature of planning
          directions such as what kind of transportation to take and how to transfer from one kind of transportation to another. They might also expect that our app provide the
         information about the transportation time, costs, and other details about stations and transfers.</p>
          <h3>The Activity/Task/Action Analysis</h3>
          <img src="../img/activity-analysis.png" class="img-col-1" alt="The diagram showing the Activity/Task/Action Analysis.">
          <p>We analyzed the activity of moving from Taipei Main Station to the university, which would go through the tasks of planning the directions,
          buying tickets, getting to the station, getting on the public transportation, getting off at the right stop, and arriving at the destination.</p>
          <p>Under the task "Planning the directions", the users have to further go through the actions of taking out their mobile devices, openning the app,
          inputting the destination, checking out possible routes, and matching the route that fits their needs.</p>
          <h3>The Seven Stages of Action</h3>
          <p>We then further analyzed the action "matching the route that fits their needs" with the seven stages of action to picture how the human mind would
          work in order to match the route that fits their needs, and to think about how can we help them through interaction design.</p>

          <h2>Research</h2>
          <p>After having the preliminary background of the issue, we conducted 4 interviews with our target audience
            who are not from Taipei and hadn't stayed in Taipei for over a year to gain a further understanding.</p>
            <h3>Key Findings</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><p><strong>When Planning</strong>
                <ul>
                  <li><p><strong>It is hard for the users to quickly find the plans that fits their needs:</strong> because it is difficult to tell that a certain plan fits
                  what kinds of needs and how many of them. For instance, if the users wants to find a plan that is the fastest and also not too
                  expensive, it is hard for them to tell which one is the fastest, which one is the cheapest, and which one is the fastest but a little
                  more expensive.</p></li>
                </ul>
              </p></li>
              <li><p><strong>When Transfering</strong>
                <ul>
                  <li><p><strong>It is hard for the users to tell which bus stop is the one they are looking for to wait for the bus they want to take:</strong>
                  because the icons of all bus stops are the same no matter they are on different sides of the road or not or they are targeted or not.</p></li>
                  <li><p><strong>It is hard for the users to tell the direction that the location indicator is pointing at:</strong> currently
                  on Google Maps the location indicatore is a gradient sector.</p></li>
                </ul>
              </p></li>
              <li><p><strong>When Riding</strong>
                <ul>
                  <li><p><strong>They users have no idea when should they get off, so they often miss the stop:</strong>
                  because sometimes there are some problems with the scrolling LED marquee, so the users have no idea where exactly they are.
                  Or even when the LED marquee works, the users still don't know at what point should they ring the bell.</p></li>
                </ul>
              </p></li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <!-- <div class="paragraph">
          <h2>Insights</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><p><strong>How might we help the users to tell if the direction plans meet their needs or not?</strong></p></li>
            <li><p><strong>How might we help the users to distinguish the bus stop they want to go from others?</strong></p></li>
            <li><p><strong>How might we let the users know where they are and when should they get off when riding?</strong></p></li>
          </ul>
        </div> -->
        <div class="paragraph">
          <h2>Insights and Ideas</h2>
          <h3>How might we help the users to tell if the direction plans meet their needs or not?</h3>
          <p>By showing users what specific features a certain direction plan has, for instance, one plan might be the fastest plan among all, another
          plan might be the cheapest, and still another plan might include fewer transfers, etc. Also, users can set their preference for sorting results (clarifying and matching their needs) in advance in the setting.</p>
          <h3>How might we help the users to distinguish the bus stop they want to go from others?</h3>
          <p>Increasing visual saliency by differentiating the visual attributes of the bus stop icons that are targeted and are on different sides of the road.</p>
          <h3>How might we let the users know where they are and when should they get off when riding?</h3>
          <p>By providing them with dynamic information about the location of the bus and which stop they are at on the bus route, and catching their attention when it's about time to get off.</p>
          <p></p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <h2>Task Analysis</h2>
          <p>Based on our insights and ideas, we listed the use cases that our app should have for our users to implement and to see, and invited a user to do <strong>card sorting</strong>
          with these use cases to further understand how the users might expect the use cases should be organized.</p>
          <p>We then analyzed these use cases by organzing them hierarchically, by classifying them according to importance, and by grouping them based on the relation of action, and then
          formed the interface by putting together the groups of use cases that are related to each other.</p>
          <img src="../img/usecase-hierar.png" class="img-col-2" alt="The diagram demonstrating the hierarchical level od the use cases.">
          <img src="../img/usecase-importance.png" class="img-col-2" alt="The diagram demonstrating the use cases grouped by importance.">
          <img src="../img/usecase-interface.png" class="img-col-1" alt="The use cases that were grouped and formed the interface.">
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <h2>Information Architecture and UI Components</h2>
          <p>Based on our research and task analysis, the information enivironment of our app consists of two part, one is the users' personalized information such as
          personal setting, saved routes, and saved places, while the other part is planning and demonstration of the directions. For personalized information,
          we structure it with the <strong>hub-and-spoke</strong> pattern, and for the planning and directions, we organize the information with the <strong>nested list</strong> pattern.</p>
          <p>After performing task analysis to form the use cases into interfaces and analyzing the information architecture of our app, we then transformed the use cases and information
          into UI components.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <h2>Brand Identity and Visual Style</h2>
          <img src="../img/taipei-go-brand.png" class="img-col-1 img-shadow" alt="Brand Identity of our app, Taipei on the Go!">
          <p>Before starting the visual design, we defined our brand identity with adjectives describing the features or characteristics of our product such as
          reliable, considerate, familiar, personalized, and so on.</p>
          <img src="../img/taipei-go-identity.png" class="img-col-1 img-shadow" style="margin-bottom:0;" alt="Brand Identity of our app, Taipei on the Go!">
          <div class="caption">Adjectives describing the features / characteristics of our product</div>
          <p>We then defined the visual style guide for our app according to the characteristics we had defined earlier.</p>
          <img src="../img/taipei-go-styleguide.png" class="img-col-1 img-shadow" alt="The visual style guide of the app.">
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <h2>Prototyping and Testing</h2>
          <p>We tested the three most important use cases with our users, which are setting their preferences for sorting results and selecting a direction plan,
          following the directions on the map to the bus stop, and getting off at the right stop.</p>
          <img src="../img/taipei-go-flow.png" class="img-col-1" alt="The screen flow of the prototype of the app.">
          <img src="../img/taipei-go-test-1.JPG" class="img-col-2 img-shadow" alt="">
          <img src="../img/taipei-go-test-2.JPG" class="img-col-2 img-shadow" alt="">
          <h3>Evaluation</h3>
          <p>Our users found that most of the actions were easy to perform and were able to solve their pain points. However, they were quite confused
          with the word "need", and they also wanted to change their preference for sorting on the planning result page.</p>

          <h2>What I Have Learned</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><p><strong>It is okay to fail:</strong> To me, this is the key and most important learning of this design thinking class. Every failing prototype tells a lesson and
            give us an opportunity to do better.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Keep questioning the assumptions and try to understand the problem from different points of view:</strong> At first, our team kept trying solving this problem by affecting
            the students behavior, but after we interviewed the janitors and the university, it gave us a whole new perspective to think about this problem, and our team also found out that this problem is actually a lot more complicated than we had thought.</p></li>
